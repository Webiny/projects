1. Host-X sends an error report to HOST-1
2. HOST 1 stores the error with MD5 (line+file+message)
3. check last occurance of this same message (store last occurance and number of occurances)
4. if same MD5 occures within 1 minute - do not send the message, just increase the occurances
5. when sending message to dev - send number of occurances
